## Git Status
- The Git status command gives us all the necessary information about the current branch. 
## Git add
- When we create, modify or delete a file, these changes will happen in our local and won't be included in the next commit (unless we change the configurations).

We need to use the git add command to include the changes of a file(s) into our next commit.
